User Input: I can give a message based of the amount of calories, like if the amount is over 2000 i will print something like "to many calories"
LLM Response: It's great that you're thinking about providing feedback based on calorie totals! Before we can give those messages, remember to initialize your total calories variable to zero with `total_calories = 0`. Once you have that, you can use an if/elif/else structure to provide feedback. For example:

```python
if total_calories < 1500:
    print("You might want to eat more.")
elif total_calories > 2000:
    print("That's too many calories!")
else:
    print("You're within a healthy range!")
```

How do you plan to implement this feedback after calculating the total?

----------------------------------------------------------

stage_correct_response_check: [[False, False], [False], [False, False], [False], [False]]
User Input: I don't know what loops are can you explain them to me?
LLM Response: Loops in programming allow you to repeat a block of code multiple times, which is perfect for tasks like gathering calorie inputs for each meal. For example, a simple `for` loop in Python looks like this: 

```python
for i in range(5):
    print("This will print 5 times.")
```

In our calorie tracker, once you know how many meals there are, you can use a loop to ask for each meal's calorie count. How do you plan to ask the user for the number of meals?

Next Steps: That's a great question about loops! They help you repeat actions, like asking for calorie inputs for each meal. Now, let's focus on gathering the number of meals. You can use `input()` to ask the user how many meals they had today. Remember to convert that input into an integer to store it properly. 

Once you have that, think about how you can set up a variable to keep track of the total calories. What do you think your next step should be after getting the meal count?

----------------------------------------------------------

----------------------------------------------------------

stage_correct_response_check: [[False, False], [False], [False, False], [False], [False]]
User Input: I would use a for loop with the number of meals
LLM Response: That's a fantastic plan! Using a for loop will help you efficiently gather calorie inputs for each meal. Before we set up that loop, let's focus on how to ask the user for the number of meals. You can use `input()` to prompt them, and remember to convert that input into an integer.

To handle unexpected inputs, consider using a while loop to keep asking until you get a valid number. For example:

```python
while True:
    number_of_meals = input("How many meals did you have today? ")
    if number_of_meals.isdigit() and int(number_of_meals) > 0:
        number_of_meals = int(number_of_meals)
        break
    else:
        print("Please enter a positive number.")
```
